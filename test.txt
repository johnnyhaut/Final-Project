Come up with a team name!
>Group 18 

As a group, come up with some ways of defining and measuring "bestness". This doesn't have to be a serious metric, it could be whimsical or secretly "worstness.”
Each group member will be responsible for one submetric each.
> Community Centers
> Wealth
> Education 
> Parks 

Combine your submetrics into a single metric as you see fit.
Create a git repository to store your data and notebooks and code.
